# 🧑‍💻 MyPeopleApp

Welcome to **MyPeopleApp** — a simple VB.NET console application created to explore a new programming language! 

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this project is to challenge myself by learning **VB.NET**, a language I haven’t used before. Since I already know **Python** and **C#**, learning VB.NET is easier — the core concepts are familiar, just with a different syntax.

## 💡 What This App Does

This app models:
- 👤 **People** (name, age, job)
- 💼 **Jobs** (title, employer, salary)
- 🎨 **Hobbies** (like “Cycling every weekend”)
- 👨‍👩‍👧 **Families** (collections of people)

It prints out data to the console using simple loops and class relationships.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- 🔧 **.NET** (VB.NET Console App)
- 📁 Simple file-based structure
- 🧪 No external packages — just learning the basics!

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

- VB.NET syntax & structure
- OOP in VB.NET (classes, properties, methods)
- Using modules and namespaces
- Building and running a .NET app from the terminal

## 📦 How to Run

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

## 🤝 Contributions?
Nope — this is a personal learning project! But feel free to use it if you’re curious about learning VB.NET too. 😄

📝 Created for fun and learning. Because trying something new is how we grow!
